It consist of 60000 32*32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class.
The label classes in the dataset are:
->airplane
->automobile
->bird
->cat
->deer
->dog
->frog
->horse
->ship
->truck
I have used the CNN with 6 convolution layers in addition with normalization and regularization with the help of dropout layer.
Data augmentation is also used to achieve better accuracy.
